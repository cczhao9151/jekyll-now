## Bootcamp Mission Statement

A data science Bootcamp should serve at least three purposes:

- Lay the groundwork of the knowledge and skills needed to become a data scientist
- Provide directions on how to prepare for interviews and land a job
- Offer network opportunities (e.g.invite practitioners for talks) and connect you with the data science community

Many Bootcamps are doing a commendable job fulfilling these expectations. 
And some people will probably benefit more than others.
Specifically:
- Those who don't know how to come up with a curriculum for themselves, or are too lazy to;
- Those who don't have the discipline to follow through, or simply prefer to study in a group environment;
- Those who have no clue how to prepare for an interview
- Those who want insider knowledge, and don't have an existing connection 

However, many of us cannot afford to attend a traditional Bootcamp, either time-wise or money-wise, or both, I included. 
So as an alternative, I am going to experiment with a home-made Bootcamp to boost my learning experience and make a leap forward.

I acknowledge that there are a couple of factors that work in my favor:
- First and foremost, I am a self-starter who is comfortable and efficient in studying at her own pace without supervision;
- I have stayed in the business world for quite a long time. I know my strength and weakness, and I know what employers are looking for
- I have a group of friends in Tech who are very generous with sharing experience and giving advice.

That said, in the next 14 weeks, here are the goals I am trying to achieve:
- Form a foundation that hopefully touches on all the relevant fields and build the momentum of studying
- Launch the capstone project and start constructing my portfolio
- Dig into the interview process specific to a data scientist position and contrive the mindmap of how to prepare
- Understand the industry landscape and different careers trajectories within data science

Let's get started.
